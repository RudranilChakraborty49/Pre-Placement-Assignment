QUESTION:

Check if a given matrix is sparse or not
Last Updated : 20 Jul, 2022
A matrix is a two-dimensional data object having m rows and n columns, therefore a total of m*n values. If most of the values of a matrix are 0 then we say that the matrix is sparse. 
Consider a definition of Sparse where a matrix is considered sparse if the number of 0s is more than half of the elements in the matrix,

Examples: 

Input : 1 0 3
        0 0 4
        6 0 0
Output : Yes
There are 5 zeros. This count
is more than half of matrix
size.

Input : 1 2 3
        0 7 8
        5 0 7 
Output: No 

ANSWER:

PYTHON:


MAX = 100
 
def isSparse(array,m, n) :
    
    counter = 0
 
   
    for i in range(0,m) :
        for j in range(0,n) :
            if (array[i][j] == 0) :
                counter = counter + 1
 
    return (counter > 
            ((m * n) // 2))


array = [ [ 1, 0, 3 ],
          [ 0, 0, 4 ],
          [ 6, 0, 0 ] ]
m = 3
n = 3

if (isSparse(array, m, n)) :
    print("Yes")
else :
    print("No")
