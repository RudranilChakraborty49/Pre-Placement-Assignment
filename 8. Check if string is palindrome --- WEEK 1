QUESTION:

Palindrome String
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 51.21%Submissions: 411K+Points: 2
You are given a string s. Your task is to determine if the string is a palindrome. A string is considered a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards.

Examples :

Input: s = "abba"
Output: true
Explanation: "abba" reads the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome.
Input: s = "abc" 
Output: false
Explanation: "abc" does not read the same forwards and backwards, so it is not a palindrome.
Input: s = "a"
Output: true
Explanation: A single-character string is always a palindrome.
Input: s = "acbca"
Output: true
Explanation: "acbca" reads the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome.
Constraints:
1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 106
The string s contains only lowercase letters (a-z).


ANSWER:


C:

#include <string.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

bool isPalindrome(char *s) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = strlen(s) - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        if (s[left] != s[right]) {
            return false;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }

    return true;
}
